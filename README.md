# Coloring-with-Words
This project was developed as a means for me to apply my working knowledge of front-end web development. While brainstorming projects for a  simple, yet non-trivial, website my mind latched onto the phrase "A picture is worth a thousand words" and I wanted to attempt to convert text data into image data. The result is a procedurally generated image where each pixel corresponds to a single "word" from a section of text. For curiosity's sake the site will also display the color value of any given word, which I arbitrarily calculated by assigning color values to common characters.

As this is currently my first and only web project it is available to view at http://ben-sevey.github.io/Coloring-with-Words.
